My Sketchbooks used Processing

Hi,
I like to draw something I love, so I interested this. Processing.
I didn't make programs so much, because I was Engineer, I couldn't to anything.
I quit because COVID, but I want to be Geek, still more, so now I come here.

What shapes do you like?
What colour do you like too?

In Japan, kids learning programming, and I want to make "like Dream"ly picture.
If you interested, talk to me.
